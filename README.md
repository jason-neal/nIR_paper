## Exploring methods to detect low mass stellar companions from blended spectra

### Abstract
Aims: We perform an exploratory study on how to directly detect the near-infared spectrum of candidate brown dwarf (BD) companions around FGK stars to measure or constrain their masses, thereby asserting their stellar nature or discarding it.

 Methods: We explore two different methods to probe the faint spectra of BD companions. The first technique involves the direct subtraction of two observations shifted to mutually cancel out the spectra of the host star. The second technique applies a $\chi^2$ fit to the individual observations with a synthetic binary model comprised of two PHOENIX-ACES spectra, representing the spectra from the host and companion. The observed spectra are wavelength calibrated and corrected for the atmospheric absorption with the aid of synthetic telluric models.
 
Results:
 The direct subtraction method failed to detect the signature of the companions. The $\chi^2$ technique developed here is able to fit the component for the host star but unable to successfully detect the faint spectra of even the largest companion in our sample. We explore how the companion recovery performs on simulated observations and discuss reasons for the non-detection observed. From the synthetic spectra we determine the upper mass limit for the companions to be around $\rm 600^{+20}_{-40}~M_{Jup}$ as the limitation of this technique for the data we had on hand.
 
Conclusions:
 This work highlights the challenges in the spectral detection of faint BD companions. We explore the limitations of the direct subtraction method in the case of small RV separation, and attempt companion recovery at low companion/host flux ratios below 3\%, finding a high upper mass limit from the technique.
