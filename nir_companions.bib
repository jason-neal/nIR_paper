  abstract = {We present new models for low-mass stars down to the hydrogen-burning limit that consistently couple atmosphere and interior structures, thereby superseding the widely used BCAH98 models. The new models include updated molecular linelists and solar abundances, as well as atmospheric convection parameters calibrated on 2D/3D radiative hydrodynamics simulations. Comparison of these models with observations in various colour-magnitude diagrams for various ages shows significant improvement over previous generations of models. The new models can solve flaws that are present in the previous ones, such as the prediction of optical colours that are too blue compared to M dwarf observations. They can also reproduce the four components of the young quadruple system LkCa 3 in a colour-magnitude diagram with one single isochrone, in contrast to any presently existing model. In this paper we also highlight the need for consistency when comparing models and observations, with the necessity of using evolutionary models and colours based on the same atmospheric structures.},

We also present evolutionary models for irradiated planets, coupling for the first time irradiated atmosphere profiles and inner structures. We focus on HD 209458-like systems and show that irradiation effects can substantially affect the radius of sub-jovian mass giant planets. Irradiation effects, however, cannot alone explain the large observed radius of HD 209458b. Adopting assumptions which optimise irradiation effects and taking into account the extension of the outer atmospheric layers, we still find \$$\backslash$sim\$ 20\% discrepancy between observed and theoretical radii. An extra source of energy seems to be required to explain the observed value of the first transit planet.},

New CORALIE radial velocities yielding accurate orbits of 6 previously-known hosts of potential brown-dwarf companions are presented. Including targets selected from the literature, 33 hosts of potential brown-dwarf companions are examined. Employing innovative methods, we use the new reduction of the Hipparcos data to fully characterise the astrometric orbits of 6 objects, revealing M-dwarf companions with masses between 90 M\_Jup and 0.52 M\_Sun. Additionally, the masses of two companions can be restricted to the stellar domain. The companion to HD 137510 is found to be a brown dwarf. At 95 \% confidence, the companion of HD 190228 is also a brown dwarf. The remaining 23 companions persist as brown-dwarf candidates. Based on the CORALIE planet-search sample, we obtain an upper limit of 0.6 \% for the frequency of brown-dwarf companions around Sun-like stars. We find that the companion-mass distribution function is rising at the lower end of the brown-dwarf mass range, suggesting that in fact we are detecting the high-mass tail of the planetary distribution.},

all possible shifts. Thus, the correlation is a two-dimensional function
whose two independent variables are the two shifts of the two
components. The location of the maximum of this function corresponds to
the actual shifts of the two components. The technique is made feasible
through the use of an Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. TODCOR
improves the analysis of binary spectra with small velocity differences,
which are difficult to analyze with the original cross correlation. The
new algorithm was tested with numerous simulated spectra. We were able
to derive the correct velocities of the two components in all cases, one
of which is presented.},

  title = {The Rotation of Brown Dwarfs},
  abstract = {One of the characteristic features of low-mass stars is their propensity to shed large amounts of angular momentum throughout their evolution. This distinguishs them from brown dwarfs which remain fast rotators over timescales of gigayears. Brown dwarfs with rotation periods longer than a couple of days have only been found in star forming regions and young clusters. This is a useful constraint on the mass dependency of mechanisms for angular momentum regular in stars. Rotational braking by disks and winds become highly inefficient in the substellar regime. In this short review I discuss the observational evidence for the fast rotation in brown dwarfs, the implications, and the link to the spin-mass relation in planets.},

  abstract = {We present a modular, extensible likelihood framework for spectroscopic inference based on synthetic model spectra. The subtraction of an imperfect model from a continuously sampled spectrum introduces covariance between adjacent datapoints (pixels) into the residual spectrum. For the high signal-to-noise data with large spectral range that is commonly employed in stellar astrophysics, that covariant structure can lead to dramatically underestimated parameter uncertainties (and, in some cases, biases). We construct a likelihood function that accounts for the structure of the covariance matrix, utilizing the machinery of Gaussian process kernels. This framework specifically address the common problem of mismatches in model spectral line strengths (with respect to data) due to intrinsic model imperfections (e.g., in the atomic/molecular databases or opacity prescriptions) by developing a novel local covariance kernel formalism that identifies and self-consistently downweights pathological spectral line "outliers." By fitting many spectra in a hierarchical manner, these local kernels provide a mechanism to learn about and build data-driven corrections to synthetic spectral libraries. An open-source software implementation of this approach is available at http://iancze.github.io/Starfish, including a sophisticated probabilistic scheme for spectral interpolation when using model libraries that are sparsely sampled in the stellar parameters. We demonstrate some salient features of the framework by fitting the high resolution \$V\$-band spectrum of WASP-14, an F5 dwarf with a transiting exoplanet, and the moderate resolution \$K\$-band spectrum of Gliese 51, an M5 field dwarf.},

These standards are now routinely used for the wavelength calibration of the cryogenic infrared echelle spectrograph (CRIRES) operated at one of the unit telescopes of the very large telescope (VLT) at ESO's La Silla Paranal Observatory in Chile. The availability of highly accurate wavelength standards from a commercially available calibration source permits a shift to a new operational paradigm for high-resolution IR spectroscopy. Wavelength calibration no longer has to rely on atmospheric features but can make use of laboratory traceable reference data as is normally done in the ultraviolet and visible regions. This opens the door for more quantitative spectroscopic work in the near-IR. To illustrate the potential impact of this development, we briefly review the current state of affairs in IR astronomy and its projected future. With the advent of the next generation of extremely large ground-based telescopes the IR region will become the most powerful window on the universe within the next 10\textendash{}15 years.

  abstract = {A line-by-line model (LBLRTM) has been applied to the calculation of clear-sky longwave fluxes and cooling rates for atmospheres including CO2, O3, CH4, N2O, CCl4, CFC-11, CFC-12, and CFC-22 in addition to water vapor. The present paper continues the approach developed in an earlier article in which the radiative properties of atmospheres with water vapor alone were reported. Tropospheric water vapor continues to be of principal importance for the longwave region due to the spectral extent of its absorbing properties, while the absorption bands of other trace species have influence over limited spectral domains. The principal effects of adding carbon dioxide are to reduce the role of the water vapor in the lower troposphere and to provide 72\% of the 13.0 K d-1 cooling rate at the stratopause. In general, the introduction of uniformly mixed trace species into atmospheres with significant amounts of water vapor has the effect of reducing the cooling associated with water vapor, providing an apparent net atmospheric heating. The radiative consequences of doubling carbon dioxide from the present level are consistent with these results. For the midlatitude summer atmosphere the heating associated with ozone that occurs from 500 to 20 mbar reaches a maximum of 0.25 K d-1 at 50 mbar and partially offsets the cooling of 1.0 K d-1 contributed by H2O and CO2 at this level. In the stratosphere the 704 cm-1 band of ozone, not included in many radiation models, contributes 25\% of the ozone cooling rate. Radiative effects associated with anticipated 10-year constituent profile changes, 1990\textendash{}2000, are presented from both a spectral and spectrally integrated perspective. The effect of the trace gases has been studied for three atmospheres: tropical, midlatitude summer, and midlatitude winter. Using these results and making a reasonable approximation for the polar regions, we obtain a value for the longwave flux at the top of the atmosphere of 265.5 W m-2, in close agreement with the clear-sky Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) observations. This agreement provides strong support for the present approach as a reference method for the study of radiative effects resulting from changes in the distributions of trace species on global radiative forcing. Many of the results from the spectral calculations reported here are archived at the Carbon Dioxide Information and Analysis Center for use by the community.},

Over the course of more than a decade, measurements of its orbital inclination have been announced and refuted, and have hitherto remained elusive. Here we report the detection of carbon monoxide absorption in the thermal dayside spectrum of $\tau$
Bo\"otis b. At a spectral resolution of \textasciitilde{}100,000, we trace the change in the radial velocity of the planet over a large range in phase, determining an orbital inclination of 44.5$^\circ$ +/- 1.5$^\circ$ and a mass
5.95 +/- 0.28 times that of Jupiter, demonstrating that atmospheric characterization is possible for non-transiting planets. The strong absorption signal points to an atmosphere with a temperature that is decreasing towards higher altitudes, in contrast to the temperature inversion inferred for other highly irradiated planets. This supports the hypothesis that the absorbing compounds believed to cause such atmospheric inversions are destroyed in $\tau$ Bo\"otis b by the
ultraviolet emission from the active host star.},

  doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201423537},
  abstract = {Context. In recent years, ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy has 
become a powerful tool for investigating exoplanet atmospheres. It
allows the robust identification of molecular species, and it can be
applied to both transiting and non-transiting planets. Radial-velocity
measurements of the star HD 179949 indicate the presence of a giant
planet companion in a close-in orbit. The system is bright enough to be
an ideal target for near-infrared, high-resolution spectroscopy. 
Aims: Here we present the analysis of spectra of the system at 2.3
$\mu$m, obtained at a resolution of R \textasciitilde{} 100 000, during three nights of
observations with CRIRES at the VLT. We targeted the system while the
exoplanet was near superior conjunction, aiming to detect the planet's
thermal spectrum and the radial component of its orbital velocity. Methods: Unlike the telluric signal, the planet signal is subject to
a changing Doppler shift during the observations. This is due to the
changing radial component of the planet orbital velocity, which is on
the order of 100-150 km s-1 for these hot Jupiters. We can
therefore effectively remove the telluric absorption while preserving
the planet signal, which is then extracted from the data by cross
correlation with a range of model spectra for the planet atmosphere. Results: We detect molecular absorption from carbon monoxide and
water vapor with a combined signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 6.3, at a
projected planet orbital velocity of KP = (142.8 $\pm$
3.4) km s-1, which translates into a planet mass of
MP = (0.98 $\pm$ 0.04) Jupiter masses, and an orbital
inclination of i = (67.7 $\pm$ 4.3) degrees, using the known stellar
radial velocity and stellar mass. The detection of absorption features
rather than emission means that, despite being highly irradiated, HD
179949 b does not have an atmospheric temperature inversion in the
probed range of pressures and temperatures. Since the host star is
active (R'HK $>$ -4.9), this is in line with the
hypothesis that stellar activity damps the onset of thermal inversion
layers owing to UV flux photo-dissociating high-altitude, optical
absorbers. Finally, our analysis favors an oxygen-rich atmosphere for HD
179949 b, although a carbon-rich planet cannot be statistically ruled
out based on these data alone.

the Program 186.C-0289.},

This theory can now be confronted with observations directly in various observational diagrams (color-color, color-magnitude, mass-magnitude, mass-spectral type), a stringent and unavoidable constraint which became possible only recently, with the generation of synthetic spectra. In this paper, we present the current state-of-the-art general theory of low-mass stars and sub-stellar objects, from one solar mass to one Jupiter mass, regarding primarily their interior structure and evolution. This review is a natural complement to the previous review on the atmosphere of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs (Allard et al 1997). Special attention is devoted to the comparison of the theory with various available observations. The contribution of low-mass stellar and sub-stellar objects to the Galactic mass budget is also analysed.},

  abstract = {Giant exoplanets orbiting very close to their parent star (hot Jupiters) are subject to tidal forces expected to synchronize their rotational and orbital periods on short timescales (tidal locking). However, spin rotation has never been measured directly for hot Jupiters. Furthermore, their atmospheres can show equatorial super-rotation via strong eastward jet streams, and/or high-altitude winds flowing from the day- to the night-side hemisphere. Planet rotation and atmospheric circulation broaden and distort the planet spectral lines to an extent that is detectable with measurements at high spectral resolution. We observed a transit of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b around 2.3 \{$\backslash$mu\}m and at a spectral resolution of R\textasciitilde{}10\$\^5\$ with CRIRES at the ESO Very Large Telescope. After correcting for the stellar absorption lines and their distortion during transit (the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect), we detect the absorption of carbon monoxide and water vapor in the planet transmission spectrum by cross-correlating with model spectra. The signal is maximized (7.6\{$\backslash$sigma\}) for a planet rotational velocity of \$(3.4\^\{+1.3\}\_\{-2.1\})\$ km/s, corresponding to a rotational period of \$(1.7\^\{+2.9\}\_\{-0.4\})\$ days. This is consistent with the planet orbital period of 2.2 days and therefore with tidal locking. We find that the rotation of HD 189733 b is longer than 1 day (3\{$\backslash$sigma\}). The data only marginally (1.5\{$\backslash$sigma\}) prefer models with rotation versus models without rotation. We measure a small day- to night-side wind speed of \$(-1.7\^\{+1.1\}\_\{-1.2\})\$ km/s. Compared to the recent detection of sodium blue-shifted by (8\$$\backslash$pm\$2) km/s, this likely implies a strong vertical wind shear between the pressures probed by near-infrared and optical transmission spectroscopy.},

for the observer. Strong molecular absorptions from species whose
concentrations vary with time can be particularly challenging to remove
precisely. Yet removing these effects is key to accurately determining
the composition of many astronomical objects - planetary atmospheres in
particular. Here, we present a method for removing telluric effects
based on a modelling approach. The method relies only on observations
usually made by the planetary astronomer, and so is directly comparable
with current techniques. We use the modelling approach to process
observations made of Jupiter, and Saturn's moon Titan and compare the
results with those of the standard telluric division technique, finding
the modelling approach to have distinct advantages even in conditions
regarded as ideal for telluric division.},

The models include the formation of over 600 gas-phase species and 1000 liquids and crystals and the opacities of 30 different types of grains including corundum (Al2O3), the magnesium aluminum spinel
MgAl2O4, iron, enstatite (MgSiO3), forsterite (Mg2SiO4), amorphous carbon, SiC, and a number of calcium silicates. The models extend from the beginning of the grain formation regime well into the condensation regime of water ice (Teff=3000-100 K) and encompass the range of logg=2.5-6.0 at solar metallicity. We find that silicate dust grains can form abundantly in the outer atmospheric layers of red and brown dwarfs with a spectral type later than M8. The greenhouse effects of dust opacities provide a natural explanation for the peculiarly red spectroscopic distribution of the latest M dwarfs and young brown dwarfs. The grainless (cond) models, on the other hand, correspond closely to methane brown dwarfs such as Gliese 229B. We also discover that the $\lambda\lambda$5891, 5897 Na I D
and $\lambda\lambda$7687, 7701 K I resonance doublets play a critical
role in T dwarfs, in which their red wings define the pseudocontinuum from the I to the Z bandpass.},

  abstract = {We present the full results of our decade-long astrometric monitoring programs targeting 31 ultracool binaries with component spectral types M7-T5. Joint analysis of resolved imaging from Keck Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope and unresolved astrometry from CFHT/WIRCam yields parallactic distances for all systems, robust orbit determinations for 23 systems, and photocenter orbits for 19 systems. As a result, we measure 38 precise individual masses spanning 30-115 \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm Jup\}\$. We determine a model-independent substellar boundary that is \$$\backslash$approx\$70 \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm Jup\}\$ in mass (\$$\backslash$approx\$L4 in spectral type), and we validate Baraffe et al. (2015) evolutionary model predictions for the lithium-depletion boundary (60 \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm Jup\}\$ at field ages). Assuming each binary is coeval, we test models of the substellar mass-luminosity relation and find that in the L/T transition, only the Saumon \& Marley (2008) "hybrid" models accounting for cloud clearing match our data. We derive a precise, mass-calibrated spectral type-effective temperature relation covering 1100-2800 K. Our masses enable a novel direct determination of the age distribution of field brown dwarfs spanning L4-T5 and 30-70 \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm Jup\}\$. We determine a median age of 1.3 Gyr, and our population synthesis modeling indicates our sample is consistent with a constant star formation history modulated by dynamical heating in the Galactic disk. We discover two triple-brown-dwarf systems, the first with directly measured masses and eccentricities. We examine the eccentricity distribution, carefully considering biases and completeness, and find that low-eccentricity orbits are significantly more common among ultracool binaries than solar-type binaries, possibly indicating the early influence of long-lived dissipative gas disks. Overall, this work represents a major advance in the empirical view of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.},

My emphasis is on low-mass stars because they are present from all epochs of star formation in the Galaxy and because they present both special opportunities and problems. The ages of open clusters are important for understanding the limitations of stellar models and for calibrating empirical age indicators. For individual stars, a hierarchy of quality for the available age-dating methods is described. Although our present ability to determine the ages of even the nearest stars is mediocre, the next few years hold great promise as asteroseismology probes beyond stellar surfaces and starts to provide precise interior properties of stars and as models continue to improve when stressed by better observations.},

These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. Their relative importance probably depends on environment, and should be judged by their ability to reproduce the brown dwarf IMF, the distribution and kinematics of newly formed brown dwarfs, the binary statistics of brown dwarfs, the ability of brown dwarfs to retain disks, and hence their ability to sustain accretion and outflows. This will require more sophisticated numerical modeling than is presently possible, in particular more realistic initial conditions and more realistic treatments of radiation transport, angular momentum transport, and magnetic fields. We discuss the minimum mass for brown dwarfs, and how brown dwarfs should be distinguished from planets.},

  abstract = {We analyzed the Hipparcos astrometric observations of 47 stars that were discovered to harbor giant planets and 14 stars with brown dwarf secondary candidates. The Hipparcos measurements were used together with the corresponding stellar radial velocity data to derive an astrometric orbit for each system. To find out the significance of the derived astrometric orbits, we applied a "permutation" technique by which we analyzed the permuted Hipparcos data to get false orbits. The size distribution of these false orbits indicated the range of possibly random, false orbits that could be derived from the true data. These tests could not find any astrometric orbit of the planet candidates with significance higher than 99\%, suggesting that most if not all orbits are not real. Instead, we used the Hipparcos data to set upper limits on the masses of the planet candidates. The lowest derived upper limit is that of 47 UMa\textemdash{}0.014 M $\Sun$ , which confirms the planetary nature of its unseen companion. For 13 other planet candidates, the upper limits exclude the stellar nature of their companions, although brown dwarf secondaries are still an option. These negate the idea that all or most of the extrasolar planets are disguised stellar secondaries. Of the 14 brown dwarf candidates, our analysis reproduced the results of Halbwachs et al., who derived significant astrometric orbits for six systems that imply secondaries with stellar masses. We show that another star, HD 164427, which was discovered only very recently, also has a secondary with stellar mass. Our findings support Halbwachs et al.'s conclusion about the possible existence of the "brown dwarf desert" that separates the planets and the stellar secondaries.},

Using follow-up K -band spectroscopy from Keck AO+NIRSPEC, we measure a spectral type of L45 with an uncertainty of $\pm$1.5 subclasses. This is the closest ultracool companion around a main-sequence star found to date by direct imaging. We estimate that the primary has an age of 1-3 Gyr. Assuming coevality, the companion is most likely substellar, with a mass of 55-78 M J based on theoretical models. The primary star shows a long-term radial velocity trend, and we combine the radial velocity data and AO imaging to set a firm (model-independent) lower limit of 48 M J . In contrast to the paucity of brown dwarf companions at \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] lesssim 4 AU around FGK dwarfs, HR 7672B implies that brown dwarf companions do exist at separations comparable to those of the giant planets in our own solar system.

Moreover, since HR 7672B is likely too massive to have formed in a circumstellar disk as planets are believed to, its discovery suggests that a diversity of physical processes act to populate the outer regions of exoplanetary systems.},

To investigate and understand their physical nature, detailed spectral information and accurate stellar models are needed. We use a new synthetic atmosphere model generation and compare model spectra to observations. To test the model accuracy, we compared the models to four benchmark stars with atmospheric parameters for which independent information from interferometric radius measurements is available. We used \$$\backslash$chi\^2\$ -based methods to determine parameters from high-resolution spectroscopic observations. Our synthetic spectra are based on the new PHOENIX grid that uses the ACES description for the equation of state.

We identified suitable spectral tracers of atmospheric parameters and determined the uncertainties in \$T\_\{$\backslash$rm eff\}\$, \$$\backslash$log\{g\}\$, and [Fe/H] resulting from degeneracies between parameters and from shortcomings of the model atmospheres. The inherent uncertainties we find are \{$\backslash$sigma\}\$T\_\{$\backslash$rm eff\}\$= 35 K, \{$\backslash$sigma\}\$$\backslash$log\{g\}\$ = 0.14, and \{$\backslash$sigma\}[Fe/H] = 0.11. The new model spectra achieve a reliable match to our observed data; our results for \$T\_\{$\backslash$rm eff\}\$ and \$$\backslash$log\{g\}\$ are consistent with literature values to within 1\{$\backslash$sigma\}. However, metallicities reported from earlier photometric and spectroscopic calibrations in some cases disagree with our results by more than 3 \{$\backslash$sigma\}. A possible explanation are systematic errors in earlier metallicity determinations that were based on insufficient descriptions of the cool atmospheres. At this point, however, we cannot definitely identify the reason for this discrepancy, but our analysis indicates that there is a large uncertainty in the accuracy of M-dwarf parameter estimates.},

TiO bands are used to determine effective temperatures in ultralow-mass objects, and together with Na- and K-lines to derive gravities at the substellar boundary. Unfortunately, model calibrations in (young) ultralow-mass objects are rare. As a first step towards a calibration of synthetic spectral features, I show molecular bands of TiO, which is a main opacity source in late M-dwarfs. The TiO $\epsilon$ -band at 8450 \AA{} is systematically too weak. This implies that temperatures determined from that band are underestimated, and I discuss implications for determining fundamental parameters from high resolution spectra.

  abstract = {Since the discovery of brown dwarfs in 1994, and the discovery of dust cloud formation in the latest Very Low Mass Stars (VLMs) and Brown Dwarfs (BDs) in 1996, the most important challenge in modeling their atmospheres as become the understanding of cloud formation and advective mixing. For this purpose, we have developed radiation hydrodynamic 2D model atmosphere simulations to study the formation of forsterite dust in presence of advection, condensation, and sedimentation across the M-L-T VLMs to BDs sequence (Teff = 2800 K to 900 K, Freytag et al. 2010). We discovered the formation of gravity waves as a driving mechanism for the formation of clouds in these atmospheres, and derived a rule for the velocity field versus atmospheric depth and Teff , which is relatively insensitive to gravity. This rule has been used in the construction of the new model atmosphere grid, BT-Settl, to determine the microturbulence velocity, the diffusion coefficient, and the advective mixing of molecules as a function of depth. This new model grid of atmospheres and synthetic spectra has beencomputedfor100,000K$>$Teff $>$400K,5.5$>$logg$>$-0.5,and[M/H]=+0.5to -1.5, and the reference solar abundances of Asplund et al. (2009). We found that the new solar abundances allow an improved (close to perfect) reproduction of the photo- metric and spectroscopic VLMs properties, and, for the first time, a smooth transition between stellar and substellar regimes -- unlike the transition between the NextGen models from Hauschildt et al. 1999a,b, and the AMES-Dusty models from Allard et al. 2001). In the BDs regime, the BT-Settl models propose an improved explanation for the M-L-T spectral transition. In this paper, we therefore present the new BT-Settl model atmosphere grid, which explains the entire transition from the stellar to planetary mass regimes.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop a spectral differential technique with which the dynamical mass of low-mass companions can be found. This method aims at discovering close companions to late-type stars by removing the stellar spectrum through a subtraction of spectra obtained at different orbital phases and discovering the companion spectrum in the difference spectrum in which the companion lines appear twice (positive and negative signal). The resulting radial velocity difference of these two signals provides the true mass of the companion, if the orbital solution for the radial velocities of the primary is known. We select the CO line region in the K band for our study, because it provides a favourable star-to-companion brightness ratio for our test case GJ 1046, an M2V dwarf with a low-mass companion that most likely is a brown dwarf. Furthermore, these lines remain largely unblended in the difference spectrum so that the radial velocity amplitude of the companion can be measured directly. Only if the companion rotates rapidly and has a small radial velocity due to a high mass, does blending occur for all lines so that our approach fails. We also consider activity of the host star, and show that the companion difference flux can be expected to have larger amplitude than the residual signal from the active star so that stellar activity does not inhibit the determination of the companion mass. In addition to determining the companion mass, we restore the single companion spectrum from the difference spectrum using singular value decomposition.

  abstract = {Although the formalism of Lecavelier des Etangs et~al. is extremely useful to understand what shapes transmission spectra of exoplanets, it does not include the effects of a sharp change in flux with altitude generally associated with surfaces and optically thick clouds. Recent advances in understanding the effects of refraction in exoplanet transmission spectra have, however, demonstrated that even clear thick atmospheres have such a sharp change in flux due to a refractive boundary. We derive a more widely applicable analytical formalism by including first-order effects from all these `surfaces' to compute an exoplanet's effective radius, effective atmospheric thickness and spectral modulation for an atmosphere with a constant scaleheight. We show that the effective radius cannot be located below these `surfaces' and that our formalism matches the formalism of Lecavelier des Etangs et~al. in the case of a clear atmosphere. Our formalism explains why clouds and refraction reduce the contrast of spectral features, and why refraction decreases the Rayleigh scattering slope as wavelength increases, but also shows that these are common effects of all `surfaces'. We introduce the concept of a `surface' cross-section, the minimum mean cross-section that can be observed, as an index to characterize the location of `surfaces' and provide a simple method to estimate their effects on the spectral modulation of homogeneous atmospheres. We finally devise a numerical recipe that extends our formalism to atmospheres with a non-constant scaleheight and arbitrary sources of opacity, a potentially necessary step to interpret observations.},

  abstract = {Measurements of radial velocity variations from the spectroscopic monitoring of stars and their companions are essential for a broad swath of astrophysics; these measurements provide access to the fundamental physical properties that dictate all phases of stellar evolution and facilitate the quantitative study of planetary systems. The conversion of those measurements into both constraints on the orbital architecture and individual component spectra can be a serious challenge, however, especially for extreme flux ratio systems and observations with relatively low sensitivity. Gaussian processes define sampling distributions of flexible, continuous functions that are well-motivated for modeling stellar spectra, enabling proficient searches for companion lines in time-series spectra. We introduce a new technique for spectral disentangling, where the posterior distributions of the orbital parameters and intrinsic, rest-frame stellar spectra are explored simultaneously without needing to invoke cross-correlation templates. To demonstrate its potential, this technique is deployed on red-optical time-series spectra of the mid-M-dwarf binary LP661-13. We report orbital parameters with improved precision compared to traditional radial velocity analysis and successfully reconstruct the primary and secondary spectra. We discuss potential applications for other stellar and exoplanet radial velocity techniques and extensions to time-variable spectra.

  abstract = {The ability to perform detailed chemical analysis of Sun-like F-, G-, and K-type stars is a powerful tool with many applications including studying the chemical evolution of the Galaxy and constraining planet formation theories. Unfortunately, complications in modeling cooler stellar atmospheres hinders similar analysis of M-dwarf stars. Empirically-calibrated methods to measure M dwarf metallicity from moderate-resolution spectra are currently limited to measuring overall metallicity and rely on astrophysical abundance correlations in stellar populations. We present a new, empirical calibration of synthetic M dwarf spectra that can be used to infer effective temperature, Fe abundance, and Ti abundance. We obtained high-resolution (R\textasciitilde{}25,000), Y-band (\textasciitilde{}1 micron) spectra of 29 M dwarfs with NIRSPEC on Keck II. Using the PHOENIX stellar atmosphere modeling code (version 15.5), we generated a grid of synthetic spectra covering a range of temperatures, metallicities, and alpha-enhancements. From our observed and synthetic spectra, we measured the equivalent widths of multiple Fe I and Ti I lines and a temperature-sensitive index based on the FeH bandhead. We used abundances measured from widely-separated solar-type companions to empirically calibrate transformations to the observed indices and equivalent widths that force agreement with the models. Our calibration achieves precisions in Teff, [Fe/H], and [Ti/Fe] of 60 K, 0.1 dex, and 0.05 dex, respectively and is calibrated for 3200 K $<$ Teff $<$ 4100 K, -0.7 $<$ [Fe/H] $<$ +0.3, and -0.05 $<$ [Ti/Fe] $<$ +0.3. This work is a step toward detailed chemical analysis of M dwarfs at a similar precision achieved for FGK stars.},

  abstract = {In contrast to planets with masses similar to that of Jupiter and higher, the bulk compositions of planets in the so-called super-Earth regime (masses 2-10 times that of the Earth) cannot be uniquely
determined from a measurement of mass and radius alone. For these planets, there is a degeneracy between the mass and composition of both the interior and a possible atmosphere in theoretical models. The recently discovered transiting super-Earth exoplanet GJ 1214b is one example of this problem. Three distinct models for the planet that are consistent with its mass and radius have been suggested. Breaking the degeneracy between these models requires obtaining constraints on the planet's atmospheric composition. Here we report a ground-based
measurement of the transmission spectrum of GJ 1214b between wavelengths of 780 and 1,000nm. The lack of features in this spectrum rules out (at 4.9$\sigma$ confidence) cloud-free atmospheres composed primarily of
hydrogen. If the planet's atmosphere is hydrogen-dominated, then it must contain clouds or hazes that are optically thick at the observed wavelengths at pressures less than 200mbar. Alternatively, the
featureless transmission spectrum is also consistent with the presence of a dense, water vapour atmosphere.},

  volume = {585},
  issn = {0004-6361},
  doi = {10/gcmdk7},
  abstract = {Context. Transiting planets around stars are discovered mostly through photometric surveys. Unlike radial velocity surveys, photometric surveys do not tend to target slow rotators, inactive or metal-rich stars. Nevertheless, we suspect that observational biases could also impact transiting-planet hosts. Aims: This paper aims to evaluate how selection effects reflect on the evolutionary stage of both a limited sample of transiting-planet host stars (TPH) and a wider sample of planet-hosting stars detected through radial velocity analysis. Then, thanks to uniform derivation of stellar ages, a homogeneous comparison between exoplanet hosts and field star age distributions is developed. Methods: Stellar parameters have been computed through our custom-developed isochrone placement algorithm, according to Padova evolutionary models. The notable aspects of our algorithm include the treatment of element diffusion, activity checks in terms of
log\{R'HK\} and vsini, and the evaluation of the stellar evolutionary speed in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram in order to better constrain age. Working with TPH, the observational stellar mean density $\rho\star$ allows us to compute stellar luminosity even if
the distance is not available, by combining $\rho\star$ with
the spectroscopic log g. Results: The median value of the TPH ages is 5 Gyr. Even if this sample is not very large, however the result is very similar to what we found for the sample of spectroscopic hosts, whose modal and median values are [3, 3.5) Gyr and 4.8 Gyr, respectively. Thus, these stellar samples suffer almost the same selection effects. An analysis of MS stars of the solar neighbourhood belonging to the same spectral types bring to an age distribution similar to the previous ones and centered around solar age value. Therefore, the age of our Sun is consistent with the age distribution of solar neighbourhood stars with spectral types from late F to early K, regardless of whether they harbour planets or not. We considered the possibility that our selected samples are older than the average disc population.},

  abstract = {Context. Planetary companions of a fixed mass induce reflex motions with 
a larger amplitude around lower-mass stars, which adds to making M
dwarfs excellent targets for extra-solar planet searches. The most
recent velocimeters with a stability of \textasciitilde{}1 m s-1 can detect
very low-mass planets out to the habitable zone of these stars. Low-mass
small planets are abundant around M dwarfs, and most of the known
potentially habitable planets orbit one of these cool stars. 
Aims: Our M-dwarf radial velocity monitoring with HARPS on the ESO 3.6 m
telescope at La Silla observatory makes a major contribution to this
sample. Methods: We present here dense radial velocity (RV) time
series for three M dwarfs observed over \textasciitilde{}five years: GJ 3293 (0.42
M$\odot$), GJ 3341 (0.47 M$\odot$), and GJ 3543 (0.45
M$\odot$). We extracted these RVs through minimum
$\chi$2-matching of each spectrum against a stack of all
observed spectra for the same star that has a high signal-to-noise
ratio. We then compared potential orbital signals against several
stellar activity indicators to distinguish the Keplerian variations
induced by planets from the spurious signals that result from rotational
modulation of stellar surface inhomogeneities and from activity cycles.
 Results: Two Neptune-mass planets - msin(i) = 1.4 $\pm$ 0.1
and 1.3 $\pm$ 0.1Mnept - orbit GJ 3293 with periods P =
30.60 $\pm$ 0.02 d and P = 123.98 $\pm$ 0.38 d, possibly together
with a super-Earth - msin(i) \textasciitilde{} 7.9 $\pm$ 1.4 M$\oplus$ -
with period P = 48.14 $\pm$ 0.12d. A super-Earth - msin(i) \textasciitilde{} 6.1
M$\oplus$ - orbits GJ 3341 with P = 14.207 $\pm$ 0.007d.
The RV variations of GJ 3543, on the other hand, reflect its stellar
activity rather than planetary signals.

Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a
redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent
hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully
considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine
meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.},

  abstract = {High resolution (R=110000), very high S/N spectra, centered on the 6707.8A LiI line have been obtained with the ESO Coude Echelle Spectrometer for five, metal-poor (-0.8 $<$ [Fe/H] $<$ -0.6) disk stars in the turnoff region of the HR-diagram. The instrumental and stellar atmospheric line broadening have been determined from two unblended iron lines and used in a model atmosphere synthesis of the profile of the LiI line as a function of the lithium isotope ratio. This has led to a detection of 6Li in HD68284 and HD130551 with 6Li/7Li = 0.05, whereas the other stars, HR2883, HR3578 and HR8181, have 6Li/7Li close to zero. By comparing Teff-values and absolute magnitudes based on Hipparcos parallaxes with recent stellar evolutionary tracks, the masses of the stars have been derived. It is shown that the two stars with 6Li present have a significantly higher mass, M = 1.05 M(sun), than the other three stars for which values between 0.85 and 1.0 M(sun) are obtained. The results are discussed in terms of models for the galactic evolution of the light elements and depletion of the lithium isotopes in stellar envelopes. It is shown that the measured 6Li abundances are in agreement with standard cosmic ray production of 6Li in the galactic disk and a moderate depletion (0.5 dex) in the stars. Recent models for the evolution of 6Li including alpha + alpha fusion reactions and predicting a high lithium isotopic ratio, 6Li/7Li = 0.3 at [Fe/H] = -0.6, require a high degree of 6Li depletion (1.0 dex) to fit the observations. Furthermore, these models imply a 7Li abundance about 0.2 dex higher than observed for metal-poor disk stars.},

  volume = {9147},
  doi = {10.1117/12.2056453},
  abstract = {This paper gives an overview of the CARMENES instrument and of the survey that will be carried out with it during the first years of operation. CARMENES (Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exoearths with Near-infrared and optical Echelle Spectrographs) is a next-generation radial-velocity instrument under construction for the 3.5m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory by a consortium of eleven Spanish and German institutions. The scientific goal of the project is conducting a 600-night exoplanet survey targeting \textasciitilde{} 300 M dwarfs with the completed instrument. The CARMENES instrument consists of two separate echelle spectrographs covering the wavelength range from 0.55 to 1.7 $\mu$m at a spectral resolution of R = 82,000, fed by fibers from the Cassegrain focus of the telescope. The spectrographs are housed in vacuum tanks providing the temperature-stabilized environments necessary to enable a 1 m/s radial velocity precision employing a simultaneous calibration with an emission-line lamp or with a Fabry-Perot etalon. For mid-M to late-M spectral types, the wavelength range around 1.0 $\mu$m (Y band) is the most important wavelength region for radial velocity work. Therefore, the efficiency of CARMENES has been optimized in this range. The CARMENES instrument consists of two spectrographs, one equipped with a 4k x 4k pixel CCD for the range 0.55 - 1.05 $\mu$m, and one with two 2k x 2k pixel HgCdTe detectors for the range from 0.95 - 1.7$\mu$m. Each spectrograph will be coupled to the 3.5m telescope with two optical fibers, one for the target, and one for calibration light. The front end contains a dichroic beam splitter and an atmospheric dispersion
corrector, to feed the light into the fibers leading to the
spectrographs. Guiding is performed with a separate camera; on-axis as well as off-axis guiding modes are implemented. Fibers with octagonal cross-section are employed to ensure good stability of the output in the presence of residual guiding errors. The fibers are continually actuated to reduce modal noise. The spectrographs are mounted on benches inside vacuum tanks located in the coud\'e laboratory of the 3.5m dome.
Each vacuum tank is equipped with a temperature stabilization system capable of keeping the temperature constant to within +/-0.01$^\circ$C over 24 hours. The visible-light spectrograph will be operated near room temperature, while the near-IR spectrograph will be cooled to \textasciitilde{} 140 K. The CARMENES instrument passed its final design review in February 2013. The MAIV phase is currently ongoing. First tests at the telescope are scheduled for early 2015. Completion of the full instrument is planned for the fall of 2015. At least 600 useable nights have been allocated at the Calar Alto 3.5m Telescope for the CARMENES survey in the time frame until 2018. A data base of M stars (dubbed CARMENCITA) has been compiled from which the CARMENES sample can be selected. CARMENCITA contains information on all relevant properties of the potential targets. Dedicated imaging, photometric, and spectroscopic observations are underway to provide crucial data on these stars that are not available in the literature.},

  abstract = {The direct detection of reflected light from exoplanets is an excellent probe for the characterization of their atmospheres. The greatest challenge for this task is the low planet-to-star flux ratio, which even in the most favourable case is of the order of \$10\^\{-4\}\$ in the optical. This ratio decreases even more for planets in their host habitable zone, typically lower than \$10\^\{-7\}\$. To reach the signal-to-noise level required for such detections, we propose to unleash the power of the Cross Correlation Function in combination with the collecting power of next generation observing facilities. The technique we propose has already yielded positive results by detecting the reflected spectral signature of 51 Pegasi b (see Martins et al. 2015). In this work, we attempted to infer the number of hours required for the detection of several planets in their host habitable zone using the aforementioned technique from theoretical EELT observations. Our results show that for 5 of the selected planets it should be possible to directly recover their reflected spectral signature.},

  abstract = {The detection of reflected light from an exoplanet is a difficult technical challenge at optical wavelengths. Even though this signal is expected to replicate the stellar signal, not only is it several orders of magnitude fainter, but it is also hidden among the stellar noise. We apply a variant of the cross-correlation technique to HARPS observations of 51 Peg to detect the reflected signal from planet 51 Peg b. Our method makes use of the cross-correlation function of a binary mask with high-resolution spectra to amplify the minute planetary signal that is present in the spectra by a factor proportional to the number of spectral lines when performing the cross correlation. The resulting cross-correlation functions are then normalized by a stellar template to remove the stellar signal. Carefully selected sections of the resulting normalized CCFs are stacked to increase the planetary signal further. The recovered signal allows probing several of the planetary properties, including its real mass and albedo. We detect evidence for the reflected signal from planet 51 Peg b at a significance of 3$\backslash$sigma\_noise. The detection of the signal permits us to infer a real mass of 0.46\^+0.06\_-0.01 M\_Jup (assuming a stellar mass of 1.04$\backslash$;M\_Sun) for the planet and an orbital inclination of 80\^+10\_-19 degrees. The analysis of the data also allows us to infer a tentative value for the (radius-dependent) geometric albedo of the planet. The results suggest that 51Peg b may be an inflated hot Jupiter with a high albedo (e.g., an albedo of 0.5 yields a radius of 1.9 $\backslash$pm 0.3 R\_Jup for a signal amplitude of 6.0$\backslash$pm0.4 x 10\^-5). We confirm that the method we perfected can be used to retrieve an exoplanet's reflected signal, even with current observing facilities. The advent of next generation of observing facilities will yield new opportunities for this type of technique to probe deeper into exoplanets.},

  volume = {594},
  shorttitle = {{{$\xi$Tauri}}},
  doi = {10/gc7qh3},
  abstract = {Context. Compact hierarchical systems are important because the effects caused by the dynamical interaction among its members occur ona human timescale. These interactions play a role in the formation of close binaries through Kozai cycles with tides. One such system is $\xi$ Tauri: it has three hierarchical orbits: 7.14 d (eclipsing components Aa, Ab), 145 d (components Aa+Ab, B), and 51 yr (components Aa+Ab+B, C). \\
 Aims: We aim to obtain physical properties of the system and to study the dynamical interaction between its components. \\
 Methods: Our analysis is based on a large series of spectroscopic photometric (including space-borne) observations and long-baseline optical and infrared spectro-interferometric observations. We used two approaches to infer the system properties: a set of observation-specific models, where all components have elliptical trajectories, and an N-body model, which computes the trajectory of each component by integrating Newton's equations of motion. \\
 Results: The triple subsystem exhibits clear signs of dynamical interaction. The most pronounced are the advance of the apsidal line and eclipse-timing variations. We determined the geometry of all three orbits using both observation-specific and N-body models. The latter correctly accounted for observed effects of the dynamical interaction, predicted cyclic variations of orbital inclinations, and determined the sense of motion of all orbits. Using perturbation theory, we demonstrate that prominent secular and periodic dynamical effects are explainable with a quadrupole interaction. We constrained the basic properties of all components, especially of members of the inner triple subsystem and detected rapid low-amplitude light variations that we attribute to co-rotating surface structures of component B. We also estimated the radius of component B. Properties of component C remain uncertain because of its low relative luminosity. We provide an independent estimate of the distance to the system. \\
 Conclusions: The accuracy and consistency of our results make $\xi$ Tau an excellent test bed for models of formation and evolution of hierarchical systems.

  abstract = {Celestial bodies with a mass of M$\approx$ 10 \{M\}\{Jup\} have been

like gas-giant planets through core accretion or like stars through
gravitational instability. I show that objects with M$\lessequivlnt$ 4
\{M\}\{Jup\} orbit metal-rich solar-type dwarf stars, a property
associated with core accretion. Objects with M$\greaterequivlnt$ 10
\{M\}\{Jup\} do not share this property. This transition is
coincident with a minimum in the occurrence rate of such objects,
suggesting that the maximum mass of a celestial body formed through core
accretion like a planet is less than 10 \{M\}\{Jup\}.
Consequently, objects with M$\greaterequivlnt$ 10 \{M\}\{Jup\} orbiting
solar-type dwarf stars likely formed through gravitational instability
and should not be thought of as planets. Theoretical models of giant
planet formation in scaled minimum-mass solar nebula
Shakura\textendash{}Sunyaev disks with standard parameters tuned to produce
giant planets predict a maximum mass nearly an order of magnitude
larger. To prevent newly formed giant planets from growing larger than
10 \{M\}\{Jup\}, protoplanetary disks must therefore be
significantly less viscous or of lower mass than typically assumed
during the runaway gas accretion stage of giant planet formation. Either
effect would act to slow the Type I/II migration of planetary
embryos/giant planets and promote their survival. These inferences are
insensitive to the host star mass, planet formation location, or
characteristic disk dissipation time.},

By this criterion, objects with masses less than $\approx$0.3 MJup are low-mass
planets, either icy or rocky. Giant planets cover the mass range 0.3 MJup-60 MJup. Analogous to the stellar main sequence, objects on the upper end of the giant planet sequence (brown dwarfs) can simply be referred to as ``high-mass giant

Part of this effect can be attributed to an improvement of atomic data and the inclusion of NLTE computations, but also the use of hydrodynamical model atmospheres seemed to play a role. This "decrease" with time of the metallicity of the solar photosphere increased the disagreement with the results from helioseismology. With a CO \textsuperscript{5} BOLD 3D model of the solar atmosphere, the CIFIST team at the Paris Observatory re-determined the photospheric solar abundances of several elements, among them C, N, and O. The spectroscopic abundances are obtained by fitting the equivalent width and/or the profile of observed spectral lines with synthetic spectra computed from the 3D model atmosphere. We conclude that the effects of granular fluctuations depend on the characteristics of the individual lines, but are found to be relevant only in a few particular cases. 3D effects are not responsible for the systematic lowering of the solar abundances in recent years.

We show spectral details of cool atmospheres at very high-resolution (R $\sim$ 40 000) and compare them with synthetic spectra computed from the recent BT-Settl atmosphere models.
Results. Our comparison shows that molecular features (TiO, VO, CaH), and atomic features (Fe I, Ti I, Na I, K I) are well-fitted by current models. We produce a relation of effective temperature versus spectral type over the entire subdwarf spectral sequence. The high-resolution of our spectra unabled us to perform a detailed comparison of the line profiles of individual elements such as Fe I, Ca II, and Ti I, and we determined accurate metallicities of these stars. These determinations in turn enabled us to calibrate the relation between metallicity and molecular-band strength indices from low-resolution spectra.
Conclusions. The new generation of models is able to reproduce various spectral features of M subdwarfs.

  abstract = {We present the results of a new series of nongray calculations of the atmospheres, spectra, colors, and evolution of extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) and brown dwarfs for effective temperatures below 1300 K. This theory encompasses most of the mass/age parameter space occupied by substellar objects and is the first spectral study down to 100 K. These calculations are in aid of the multitude of searches being conducted or planned around the world for giant planets and brown dwarfs and reveal the exotic nature of the class. Generically, absorption by H2 at longer wavelengths and H2O opacity windows at shorter wavelengths conspire to redistribute flux blueward. Below 1200 K, methane is the dominant carbon bearing molecule and is a universal diagnostic feature of EGP and brown dwarf spectra. We find that the primary bands in which to search are Z (\textasciitilde{}1.05 $\mu$m), J (\textasciitilde{}1.2 $\mu$m), H (\textasciitilde{}1.6 $\mu$m), K (\textasciitilde{}2.2 $\mu$m), M (\textasciitilde{}5 $\mu$m), and N (\textasciitilde{}10 $\mu$m), that
enhancements of the emergent flux over blackbody values, in particular in the near infrared, can be by many orders of magnitude, and that the infrared colors of EGPs and brown dwarfs are much bluer than previously believed. In particular, relative to J and H, the K band flux is reduced by CH4 and H2 absorption. Furthermore, we conclude that for Teff's below 1200 K most or all true metals may be sequestered below the photosphere, that an interior radiative zone is a generic feature of substellar objects, and that clouds of H2O and NH3 are formed for Teff's below \textasciitilde{}400 and \textasciitilde{}200 K, respectively. This study is done for solar-metallicity objects in isolation and does not include the effects of stellar insulation. Nevertheless, it is a comprehensive attempt to bridge the gap between the planetary and stellar realms and to develop a nongray theory of objects from 0.3MJ (‘‘Saturn'') to 70MJ (\textasciitilde{}0.07 M$\odot$). We find that the detection ranges for brown
dwarf/EGP discovery of both ground- and space-based telescopes are larger than previously estimated.},

derive the RVs and additional spectral diagnostics implemented in the

templates created by coadding all available spectra of each star. We
define the chromatic index as the RV gradient as a function of
wavelength with the RVs measured in the echelle orders. Additionally, we
computed the differential line width by correlating the fit residuals
with the second derivative of the template to track variations in the
stellar line width. Results: Using HARPS data, our SERVAL code
achieves a RV precision at the level of 1 m/s. Applying the chromatic
index to CARMENES data of the active star YZ CMi, we identify apparent
RV variations induced by stellar activity. The differential line width
is found to be an alternative indicator to the commonly used full width
half maximum. Conclusions: We find that at the red optical
wavelengths (700-900 nm) obtained by the visual channel of CARMENES, the
chromatic index is an excellent tool to investigate stellar active
regions and to identify and perhaps even correct for activity-induced RV
variations.},

  issn = {0004-6361},
  doi = {10/gcmdf8},
  abstract = {Context. Recent studies have shown that close-in brown dwarfs in the mass range 35-55 MJup are almost depleted as companions to stars, suggesting that objects with masses above and below this gap might have different formation mechanisms. Aims: We aim to test whether stars harbouring massive brown dwarfs and stars with low-mass brown dwarfs show any chemical peculiarity that could be related to different formation processes. Methods: Our methodology is based on the analysis of high-resolution \'echelle spectra (R 57 000)
from 2-3 m class telescopes. We determine the fundamental stellar parameters, as well as individual abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Zn for a large sample of stars known to have a substellar companion in the brown dwarf regime. The sample is divided into stars hosting massive and low-mass brown dwarfs. Following previous works, a threshold of 42.5 MJup was considered. The metallicity and abundance trends of the two subsamples are compared and set in the context of current models of planetary and brown dwarf formation. Results: Our results confirm that stars with brown dwarf companions do not follow the well-established gas-giant planet metallicity correlation seen in main-sequence planet hosts. Stars harbouring massive brown dwarfs show similar metallicity and abundance distribution as stars without known planets or with low-mass planets. We find a tendency of stars harbouring less-massive brown dwarfs of having slightly higher metallicity, [XFe/Fe] values, and abundances of Sc II, Mn I, and Ni I than the stars having the massive brown dwarfs. The data suggest, as previously reported, that massive and low-mass
brown dwarfs might present differences in period and eccentricity. Conclusions: We find evidence of a non-metallicity dependent
mechanism for the formation of massive brown dwarfs. Our results agree
with a scenario in which massive brown dwarfs are formed as stars. At
high metallicities, the core-accretion mechanism might become efficient
in the formation of low-mass brown dwarfs, while at lower metallicities
low-mass brown dwarfs could form by gravitational instability in
turbulent protostellar discs.

features to about 2\%, even close to saturated line cores. Thus,
synthetic telluric spectra could be used to replace the observation of
telluric standard stars, saving valuable observing time. This technique
also provides a precise in-situ wavelength calibration, especially
useful for high-resolution near-infrared spectra in the absence of other
calibration sources.

  abstract = {We target the thermal emission spectrum of the non-transiting gas giant HD 88133 b with high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy, by treating the planet and its host star as a spectroscopic binary. For sufficiently deep summed flux observations of the star and planet across multiple epochs, it is possible to resolve the signal of the hot gas giant's atmosphere compared to the brighter stellar spectrum, at a level consistent with the aggregate shot noise of the full data set. To do this, we first perform a principal component analysis to remove the contribution of the Earth's atmosphere to the observed spectra. Then, we use a cross-correlation analysis to tease out the spectra of the host star and HD 88133 b to determine its orbit and identify key sources of atmospheric opacity. In total, six epochs of Keck NIRSPEC L-band observations and three epochs of Keck NIRSPEC K-band observations of the HD 88133 system were obtained. Based on an analysis of the maximum likelihood curves calculated from the multi-epoch cross-correlation of the full data set with two atmospheric models, we report the direct detection of the emission spectrum of the non-transiting exoplanet HD 88133 b and measure a radial projection of the Keplerian orbital velocity of 40 $\pm$ 15 km/s, a true mass of \{1.02\}\{MJ\}, a nearly face-on orbital inclination of \{15\}\$$\backslash$circ\$ , and an atmosphere opacity structure at high dispersion dominated by water vapor.

If the orbital velocity of the planet could be determined, the masses of both star and planet could be calculated using Newton's law of gravity, just as in the case of stellar double-line eclipsing binaries. Here we report high-dispersion ground-based spectroscopy of a transit of the extrasolar planet HD209458b. We see a significant wavelength shift in absorption lines from carbon monoxide in the planet's atmosphere, which we conclude arises from a change in the radial component of the planet's orbital velocity. The masses of the star and planet are 1.00+/-0.22M\textsubscript{Sun} and 0.64+/-0.09M\textsubscript{Jup} respectively. A blueshift of the carbon monoxide signal of approximately 2kms\textsuperscript{-1} with respect to the systemic velocity of the host star suggests the presence of a strong wind flowing from the irradiated dayside to the non-irradiated nightside of the planet within the 0.01-0.1mbar atmospheric pressure range probed by these observations.

We are also able to find evidence for triple and quadruple systems, given that any
additional companions are sufficiently bright. The precise threshold percentage depends on the signal-to-noise of the spectrum and the properties of the two stars. For cases of non-detection, we place a limit on the brightness of any potential companions. This algorithm is useful for detecting faint orbiting companions and background stars that are angularly close to a foreground target star. The size of the entrance slit to the spectrometer, 0.87 \texttimes{} 3 arcsec (typically),

  abstract = {Context. At about 1000 days after the launch of Gaia we present the first Gaia data release, Gaia DR1, consisting of astrometry and photometry for over 1 billion sources brighter than magnitude 20.7. \\
 Aims: A summary of Gaia DR1 is presented along with illustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion of the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. \\
 Methods: The raw data collected by Gaia during the first 14 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into an astrometric and photometric catalogue. \\
 Results: Gaia DR1 consists of three components: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions, parallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars in common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues - a realisation of the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) - and a secondary astrometric data set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The second component is the photometric data set, consisting of mean G-band magnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of 3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south ecliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set the typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and about 1 mas yr\textsuperscript{-1} for the proper motions. A systematic component of 0.3 mas should be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of 94 000 Hipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more precise at about 0.06 mas yr\textsuperscript{-1}. For the secondary astrometric data set, the typical uncertainty of the positions is 10 mas. The median uncertainties on the mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to 0.03 mag over the magnitude range 5 to 20.7. \\
 Conclusions: Gaia DR1 is an important milestone ahead of the next Gaia data release, which will feature five-parameter astrometry for all sources. Extensive validation shows that Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping of the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin observational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this first Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the data quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions from the data.},

  abstract = {We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system. A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the \$G\_$\backslash$mathrm\{BP\}\$ (330--680 nm) and \$G\_$\backslash$mathrm\{RP\}\$ (630--1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent.},

  abstract = {Context. We propose a method for observing transiting exoplanets with near-infrared high-resolution spectrometers. Aims: We aim to create a robust data analysis method for recovering atmospheric
transmission spectra from transiting exoplanets over a wide wavelength range in the near-infrared. Methods: By using an inverse method approach, combined with stellar models and telluric transmission spectra, the method recovers the transiting exoplanet's atmospheric transmittance at high precision over a wide wavelength range. We describe our method and have tested it by simulating observations. Results: This method is capable of recovering transmission spectra of high enough accuracy to identify absorption features from molecules such as O2, CH4, CO2, and H2O. This accuracy is achievable for Jupiter-size exoplanets at S/N that can be reached for 8 m class telescopes using high-resolution spectrometers (R$>$ 20 000) during a single transit, and for Earth-size planets and super-Earths transiting late K or M dwarf stars at S/N reachable during observations of less than 10 transits. We also analyse potential error sources to show the robustness of the method. Conclusions: Detection and characterization of atmospheres of both Jupiter-size planets and smaller rocky planets looks promising using this set-up.},

Our equation of state includes 105 molecules and up to 27 ionization stages of 39 elements. In the calculations of the base grid of model atmospheres presented here, we include over 300 molecular bands of four molecules (TiO, VO, CaH, FeH) in the JOLA approximation, the water opacity of Ludwig (1971), collision-induced opacities, b-f and f-f atomic processes, as well as about 2 million spectral lines selected from a list with more than 42 million atomic and 24 million molecular (H2, CH, NH, OH, MgH, SiH, C2, CN, CO, SiO) lines. High-resolution synthetic spectra are obtained using an opacity sampling method. The model atmospheres and spectra are calculated with the generalized stellar atmosphere code PHOENIX, assuming LTE,
plane-parallel geometry, energy (radiative plus convective)
conservation, and hydrostatic equilibrium. The model spectra give close agreement with observations of M dwarfs across a wide spectral range from the blue to the near-IR, with one notable exception: the fit to the water bands. We discuss several practical applications of our model grid, e.g., broadband colors derived from the synthetic spectra. In light of current efforts to identify genuine brown dwarfs, we also show how low-resolution spectra of cool dwarfs vary with surface gravity, and how the high-regulation line profile of the Li I resonance doublet depends on the Li abundance.},

  issn = {0004-6361},
  doi = {10/gdwsfb},
  abstract = {The false-positive probability (FPP) of Kepler transiting candidates is 
a key value for statistical studies of candidate properties. A previous
investigation of the stellar population in the Kepler field has provided
an estimate for the FPP of less than 5\% for most of the candidates. We
report here the results of our radial velocity observations on a sample
of 46 Kepler candidates with a transit depth greater than 0.4\%, orbital
period less than 25 days and host star brighter than Kepler magnitude
14.7. We used the SOPHIE spectrograph mounted on the 1.93-m telescope at
the Observatoire de Haute-Provence to establish the nature of the
transiting candidates. In this sample, we found five undiluted eclipsing
binaries, two brown dwarfs, six diluted eclipsing binaries, and nine new
transiting planets that complement the 11 already published planets. The
remaining 13 candidates were not followed-up or remain unsolved due to
photon noise limitation or lack of observations. From these results we
computed the FPP for Kepler close-in giant candidates to be 34.8\%
$\pm$ 6.5\%. We aimed to investigate the variation of the FPP for
giant candidates with the longer orbital periods and found that it
should be constant for orbital periods between 10 and 200 days. This
significantly disagrees with the previous estimates. We discuss the
reasons for this discrepancy and the possible extension of this work
toward smaller planet candidates. Finally, taking the false-positive
rate into account, we refined the occurrence rate of hot Jupiters from
the Kepler data.

The new high-resolution spectrographs are operating in the visible and near-infrared at Calar Alto Observatory. They will perform high-accuracy radial-velocity measurements (goal 1 m s-1 ) of about 300 M-dwarfs with the aim to detect low-mass planets within habitable zones. We characterised the candidate sample for CARMENES and provide fundamental parameters for these stars in order to constrain planetary properties and understand star-planet systems. Using state-of-the-art model atmospheres (PHOENIX-ACES) and $\chi$2-minimization with a downhill-simplex method we determine effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity [Fe/H] for high-resolution spectra of around 480 stars of spectral types M0.0-6.5V taken with FEROS, CAFE and HRS. We find good agreement between the models and our observed high-resolution spectra. We show the performance of the algorithm, as well as results, parameter and spectral type distributions for the CARMENES candidate sample, which is used to define the CARMENES target sample.

  abstract = {Context. At young ages, low surface gravity affects the atmospheric properties of ultracool dwarfs. The impact on medium-resolution
near-infrared (NIR) spectra has only been slightly investigated at the M-L transition so far. Aims: We present a library of NIR
(1.1-2.45 $\mu$m) medium-resolution (R \textasciitilde{} 1500-2000) integral field
spectra of 15 young M6-L0 dwarfs. We aim at deriving updated NIR spectral type, luminosity, and physical parameters (Teff, log g, M, L/L$\odot$) for each source. This work also aims at
testing the latest generation of BT-SETTL atmospheric models. Methods: We estimated spectral types using spectral indices and the spectra of young objects classified in the optical. We used the 2010 and 2012 releases of the BT-SETTL synthetic spectral grid and cross-checked the results with the DRIFT-PHOENIX models to derive the atmospheric properties of the sources. Results: We do not find significant differences between the spectra of young companions and those of young isolated brown dwarfs in the same spectral type range. We derive infrared spectral types L0 $\pm$ 1, L0 $\pm$ 1, M9.5 $\pm$ 0.5,
M9.5 $\pm$ 0.5, M9.25 $\pm$ 0.25,
M8+0.5-0.75, and M8.5 $\pm$ 0.5 for AB Pic b,
Cha J110913-773444, USco CTIO 108B, GSC 08047-00232 B, DH Tau B, CT Cha b, and HR7329B, respectively. The BT-SETTL and DRIFT-PHOENIX models yield close Teff and log g estimates for each source. The models seem to show a 600+600-300 K drop in the effective temperature at the M-L transition. Assuming the former temperatures are correct, we then derive new mass estimates that confirm that DH Tau B, USco CTIO 108B, AB Pic b, KPNO Tau 4, OTS 44, and Cha1109 lie inside or at the boundary of the planetary mass range. We combine the empirical luminosities of the M9.5-L0 sources to the Teff to derive semi-empirical radii estimates that do not match "hot-start" evolutionary models predictions at 1-3 Myr. We use complementary data to demonstrate that atmospheric models are able to reproduce the combined optical and infrared spectral energy distribution, together with the NIR spectra of these sources simultaneously. But the models still fail to represent the dominant features in the optical. This issue raises doubts on the ability of these models to predict effective temperatures from NIR spectra alone. Conclusions: The library provides templates for characterizing other young and late type objects. The study
advocates the use of photometric and spectroscopic information over a broad range of wavelengths to study the properties of very low-mass young companions to be detected with the planet imagers (Subaru/SCExAO, LBT/LMIRCam, Gemini/GPI, VLT/SPHERE).

  volume = {501},
  issn = {0004-6361},
  doi = {10/fqb746},
  abstract = {Aims: We determine the effective temperature, surface gravity and 
projected rotational velocity of nine T dwarfs from the comparison of
high-resolution near-infrared spectra and synthetic models, and estimate
the mass and age of the objects from state-of-the-art models. Methods: We use the AMES-COND cloudless solar metallicity models
provided by the PHOENIX code to match the spectra of nine T-type field
dwarfs observed with the near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph
NIRSPEC using ten echelle orders to cover part of the J band from 1.147
to 1.347 $\mu$m with a resolving power R\texttildelow{}20 000. The projected
rotational velocity, effective temperature and surface gravity of the
objects are determined based on the minimum root mean square of the
differences between the modelled and observed relative fluxes. Estimates
of the mass and age of the objects are obtained from effective
temperature-surface gravity diagrams, where our results are compared
with existing solar metallicity models. Results: The modelled
spectra reproduce quite well the observed features for most of the T
dwarfs, with effective temperatures in the range of 922-1009 K, and
surface gravities between 104.1 and 104.9 cm
s-2. Our results support the assumption of a dust free
atmosphere for T dwarfs later than T5, where dust grains form and then
gravitationally sediment into the low atmosphere. The modelled spectra
do not accurately mimic some individual very strong lines like the K i
doublet at 1.2436 and 1.2525 $\mu$m. Our modelled spectra does not match
well the observed spectra of the two T dwarfs with earlier spectral
types, namely SDSSp J125453.90-012247.4 (T2) and
2MASS J05591914-1404488 (T4.5), which is likely due
to the presence of condensate clouds that are not incorporated in the
models used here. By comparing our results and their uncertainties to
evolutionary models, we estimate masses in the interval
$\approx$5-75\textasciitilde{}MJ for T dwarfs later than T5, which are in good
agreement with those found in the literature. We found apparent young
ages that are typically between 0.1 and a few Gyr for the same T dwarfs,
which is consistent with recent kinematical studies.
